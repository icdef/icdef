### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kian and I am a Master graduate from TU Vienna in Software Engineering & Internet Computing. With a keen interest in technology and its applications, I find myself most captivated by programming in Java. 
Beyond programming, I am deeply fascinated by the realm of Cloud Computing. I aspire to transition into a Cloud Engineer role, leveraging my expertise in software engineering to design, deploy, and manage cloud-based solutions effectively.
